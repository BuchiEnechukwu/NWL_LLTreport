The team have identified an innovation to increase the uptake of lipid lowering therapies (LLT) for patients at risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in order to
prevent adverse events like strokes or heart attacks. You have been asked to use CVDPREVENT data to describe the number of patients North West London who
may be eligible for LLTs, and identify any potential inequalities or other important factors in the uptake of LLT for certain groups of patients.

Key questions that the team want to understand:
 The number of patients with CVD (secondary prevention) in NWL who are not currently on LLT
 The number of patients at high risk of CVD (primary prevention) who are not currently on LLT
 Are there any other insights in the data for either of the two cohorts above that could be of importance to the team?
 What has been the trend in the above cohorts since September 2021, and can we predict what the likely number of patients with CVD or at high risk of
CVD in NWL will be in 1 or 2 years based on the historical trend?
